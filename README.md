# Project RPG
is a Minecraft modding framework bringing RPG elements to your Mineraft world.  

Users choose the RPG-style elements they want in their worlds by selecting addons with features they desire.  The central library mod of Project RPG acts as the hub for these separate features and creates the cohesive experience for users.

### Common Configurations
Extensible configuration features mean you can create datapacks that work with all kinds of addons without needing to have a million configs for different setups.
